    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <div class="originText ">
      <p>Pixar originated in the 70s when Ed Catmull was hired by Lucasfilm to improve the graphic tecnulogy at that time. Ed's division developed the Pixar Image Computer with the ability to render high quality 3D culor images.</p>
      <p>Just in 1986 the division became indepent and thus originating Pixar which was acquired by Steve Jobs, with the intent of merchandising Pixar's computer.</p>
      <p>In 1989, through and agreement with Disney, Pixar started to work in Toy Story, becoming than the company that we all know nowadays.</p>

    <h2>Nowadays</h2>
    <p>Today the Pixar that we all sane people love released multiple amazing movies, with even greater stories and messages.</p>
    <p>I c  an't choose a top something so here are the ones that I most recommend!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="soul card">
    <img class="listImage" src="images/Soul.webp" alt="Soul gif">
    <h3 class="movieName">Soul</h3>
    <p>Soul is a great movie when you're felling overwhelmed and that life is working not out to you, besides the great sound track focused on jazz and really interesting characters.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="walle card">
    <img class="listImage" src="images/wall-e.webp" alt="Wall-E gif">
    <h3 class="movieName">Wall-E</h3>
    <p>I remember when I first watched Wall-E that I was just amazed, loved every bit of it and how a movie with barely any voice lines can make you so attached to its main characters.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="coco card">
    <img class="listImage" src="images/coco.webp" alt="Coco gif">
    <h3 class="movieName">Coco</h3>
    <p>Coco is a great tear jerker, probably my favourite way of representing the afterlife and how death is as well part of life, the great music conection just ties everything together</p>       
  </div>

  <div class="ratatouille card">
    <img class="listImage" src="images/ratatouille.webp" alt="Ratatouille gif">
    <h3 class="movieName">Ratatouille</h3>
    <p>Ever put yourself down because of some dumb sterotype? Break that when you watch a simple rat conquer his dream by just believing in himself, something that is rare nowadays but very needed.</p>
