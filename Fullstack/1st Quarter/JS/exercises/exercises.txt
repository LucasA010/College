 1. Write a JavaScript program that displays "Hello, World!" in the browser console.
 2. Create a JavaScript function that takes two numbers as input, performs addition,
 subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on them, and displays the results
 in the browser console.
 3. Write a JavaScript program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop and
 another version using a while loop.
 4. Write a JavaScript program that checks if a given number is even or odd and displays
 the result in the browser console.
 5. Create an array of 5 names. Use a for loop to iterate through the array and print
 each name in the browser console.
 6. Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.
 7. Create a function that checks whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome. A
 palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backwards as forwards.
 8. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz"
 instead of the number, and for the multiples of 5, print "Buzz." For numbers which are
 multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz."
 9. Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the length of the longest word
 in the string.
 10. Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels (a, e, i,
 o, u) in the string.
 11. Create a function that takes a positive integer as input and returns its factorial. The
 factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or
 equal to n.
 12. Write a function that generates the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. The
 Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the
 two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.
 13. Write a function that finds the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below a given number.
 14. Create a function that checks if a given number is a prime number. A prime number
 is a number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself.
 15. Create a function that takes a string and a number as input, and returns the Caesar
 cipher of the string, shifted by the given number. The Caesar cipher is a simple
 encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some
 fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
